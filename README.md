This is a very strong ENCRYTOR AND DECRYPTOR. It is almost unhackable.
There is a .db file which stores the data in the database. It should be created automatically when you run the EncryptorDecryptor.py file

all you need to do is:
pip install cryptography
python EncryptDecrypt.py

There you go! All done!
